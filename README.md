# ROOM 15

## Builds
Tou can try it [here](http://room15.surge.sh).

## Description
Based on the experience of going to the movies, we tried transcribing the different steps: 
Entering the cinema, waiting for the movie, then watching it.

Room 15 is an experience from two different angles: one as the user who enters the cinema and watching the data related to the number of people who wo watched the one of the 5,000 films that we have selected.
